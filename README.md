Hello Clojure World
===================

So, i wanted to learn functional programming. I was told, try clojure. This
is my repository for experiments and fails with clojure. Lets see. I have no
real plan for now. The only thing i want to do, is learn functional programming
in clojure.

So this is most likely for me and my future reference. I do have
a programming background, but have never touched anything functionl before. Well
I did some haskell yeats back, but actually i only remember that i was unable
to follow anything that was told. As said, i do have a solid understanding
of programming.

I am doing this right now on my mac. So the obvious first step is
to install clojure using homebrew. That installed me 1.9.0 of the language.

Some Resources i will obviously need to work through are:

 * https://clojure.org/index (that felt kind of rough for a newbie like me)
 * https://www.braveclojure.com/ (Looks like a good starting point)
 * http://www.learn-clojure.com/ (semms inactive?)

Yeah, actually braveclojure seems like exactly the thing i need. Will have
to leav the Atom now and read the thing.
