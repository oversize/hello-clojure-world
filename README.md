Hello Clojure World
===================

So, i wanted to learn functional programming. I was told, try clojure. This
is my repository for experiments and fails with clojure. Lets see.

So, i have no real plans up until now. The only thing i want to do, is learn
functional programming in clojure. Pretty simple, heh?
